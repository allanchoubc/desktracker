## Desk Tracker 

A hosted web service that provides customizable data entry forms and graphical reporting for central tracking of all library service points. Since using Desk Tracker requires only a web browser, there is nothing to install. Reporting is fast and friendly with unlimited flexibility.

While Desk Tracker gives you all the tools to manage your system, we are available to help whenever you need it. The service includes an initial free customization and setup of all forms.
